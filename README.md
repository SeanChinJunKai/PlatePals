# PlatePals

## Overview
One of the most difficult decisions that students have to make is the question of what to eat and with so many choices, students often default to the same old food options that they are used to. Our app aims to solve this issue by helping these students choose through the power of random selection! Students simply set their parameters (eg. preferences or dietary restrictions) and PlatePals will do the rest!

## Features
- **Filter** based on food preferences, dietary restrictions and price points.
- Receive a **randomised** food option based on given filters.
- Option to **re-generate choices** if you don't like what you get.
